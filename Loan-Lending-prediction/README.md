# Problem Statement

The data contains loan data for the loans issued and latest payment information. Your aim here is to predict the loan_status (Whether the loan is fully paid or not?)

# Outcomes

The main objective of this task is to provide you with an open field where you can practice and work your way with a dataset end to end without any restrictions from our side. So feel free to play around the model until you arrive at your best solution.

In this project, you will apply the following concepts:

Train-test split
Correlation between the features
Feature Selection Techniques
Logistics Regression
F1 Score Evaluation Metrics


After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to build a logistics regression model with feature selection technique.
